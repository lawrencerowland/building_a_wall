      <h1>Systems Thinking & Stakeholders</h1>
      <p>Successful innovation requires seeing the whole system. This section helps your team apply systems thinking, so you can anticipate how changes in one area might impact others. Using simple maps and examples, we illustrate how a project’s stakeholders, processes, and environment form an interconnected network – often with feedback loops and unexpected influences. You’ll learn strategies to identify bottlenecks and delays in decision-making (sometimes called decision latency) and ways to reduce them for faster, better outcomes.</p>
      <p>For instance, a delay in approving a design change can ripple through and slow down multiple teams; here we offer tips to map out your decision paths and find where latency might occur. We also discuss how to balance structured procedures with agility: large initiatives can face a tension between sticking to rigid processes and needing to adapt to changing circumstances. By understanding your project as a dynamic system of many moving parts, you’ll be better equipped to respond to new challenges and keep stakeholders aligned. This page provides a generic toolkit – from stakeholder influence diagrams to system feedback checklists – to guide your thinking without relying on any industry-specific context.</p>
