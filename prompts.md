This was used for the construction simulation app just added, saying prompt "AlgebraicJulia simulation – Have the agent install the AlgebraicDynamics package in a Julia notebook (inside the terminal) and write a small program to model the construction project as an operad algebra. It simulates wall height over time and roof stability using discrete and continuous dynamics, then visualises the wiring diagram and plots of state variables. The agent produces an interactive HTML with embedded diagrams and charts."

Saying this was used for the block diagram comparison: "Block-diagram comparison – Use the semantics paper’s observation that wiring diagrams are similar to engineering block diagrams. The agent fetches a standard SysML block diagram for building construction and converts it into a categorical wiring diagram by identifying inputs and outputs. It explains the mapping under the diagram and highlights the advantages of the formal semantics (e.g., compositionality, traceability)."
